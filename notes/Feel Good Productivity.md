2. Embracing curiosity. Make more side questions.
3. Asking myself more often that "what would this look like if it were fun".

5. Don't be serious, be sincere. Asking myself that how can I approach this with less seriousness and more sincerity.

    - Verbal persuasion. Talking positively to the mirror actually helps.
    - What would it look like if I approached this task feeling confident and I could do it?
2. Vicarious mastery. When someone shows another person how to do a task, it can help the other person believe they can do it too. So, feel free to observe how other people do the similar tasks.
