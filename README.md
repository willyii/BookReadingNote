# BookReadingNote
The note of books I have read recently. Inspired by the book **Feel Good Productivity**, I decided to read a book per month and make notes accordingly. Given the notes are kind of random and hard to search back in the future, I open this repository to save it.

Books are random, will be mixed with Chinese and English. I will do my best if English version is available.
